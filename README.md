### Howdy

I'm currently focusing my time on helping organizations and institutions with web development/consulting

I'm prioritizing organizations who are working towards dismantling patriarchy and white supremacy; who work outside of capitalism; focused on communities, arts, gardening, public transit.

I don't expect every org to match up 100%, but if you think I might be able to help, [please reach out](mailto:zack@zackseuberling.com).

My primary technology concerns these days are: accessibility, performance, and cost to operate.
